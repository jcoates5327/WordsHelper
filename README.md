# WordsHelper
A fun tool written in Java that analyzes a board state of the mobile game Words with Friends and determines the highest-scoring move for that state. Actually mostly works aside from a few edge cases. Doesn't handle blank tiles very well and there is no easy way at the moment to input a board.

It's not super efficient, just a brute force scan of all possible words that can be played in every valid position on the board. Would like to find a better way at some point, would also help clean up the code a bit.
